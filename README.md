# Retina-Vessel-Segmentation
This project focuses on segmenting retinal blood vessels using advanced image processing techniques. It is crucial for enhancing diagnostics in ophthalmology, where retinal vasculature reflects various systemic diseases. Automated retinal vessel segmentation plays a significant role in early disease detection, monitoring, and improving patient outcomes by enabling efficient analysis of large datasets. The project aims to provide healthcare professionals with reliable and interpretable tools, reducing manual workload and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
